                <p>&emsp;Greetings, my name is Quentin Johnson. I am an Accelerated Masters student studying <br>Computer Engineering. In my free time I enjoy photography, bird watching, and gaming.<br> 
                    For this project I worked on the front-end design and helped with website functionality. <br>My contact is: quentinj@arizona.edu

                <p>&emsp;Hello! My name is Megan Mickey. I am a senior studying Electrical and Computer <br>Engineering. I also have minors in Computer Science and Korean Language. I enjoy <br>cooking, playing soccer, 
                    and reading when I have time. I mostly worked on the <br>hardware and embedded programming for the project. <br> My contact is: meganfaithmickey@arizona.edu

                <p>&emsp;My name is Alan Manuel Loreto Corn√≠dez. My goal has, and always will be to achieve <br>excellence in every action I take. If I am not immediately good at something, I will <br>practice until I am. 
                    My determination has met no bound, and I never intend to let it do <br>so. I like cars, guitars, photography, and computers. Currently I seek a Master's degree <br>via the accelerated master's program at the UofA, 
                    if I find a job that I enjoy I will go into <br>industry immediately after I graduate my bachelor program. <br> My contact is: aloretocornidez@arizona.edu</p>
